MIT Kerberos is a project of the MIT Kerberos Consortium.  For more
information about the Kerberos Consortium, see http://kerberos.org/

effort should visit http://k5wiki.kerberos.org/

Building and Installing Kerberos 5
----------------------------------

The first file you should look at is doc/install-guide.ps; it contains
the notes for building and installing Kerberos 5.  The info file
krb5-install.info has the same information in info file format.  You
can view this using the GNU emacs info-mode, or by using the
standalone info file viewer from the Free Software Foundation.  This
is also available as an HTML file, install.html.

Other good files to look at are admin-guide.ps and user-guide.ps,
which contain the system administrator's guide, and the user's guide,
respectively.  They are also available as info files
kerberos-admin.info and krb5-user.info, respectively.  These files are
also available as HTML files.

If you are attempting to build under Windows, please see the
src/windows/README file.

Reporting Bugs
--------------

Please report any problems/bugs/comments using the krb5-send-pr
program.  The krb5-send-pr program will be installed in the sbin
directory once you have successfully compiled and installed Kerberos
V5 (or if you have installed one of our binary distributions).

If you are not able to use krb5-send-pr because you haven't been able
compile and install Kerberos V5 on any platform, you may send mail to
krb5-bugs@mit.edu.

Please keep in mind that unencrypted e-mail is not secure. If you need
to report a security vulnerability, or send sensitive information,
please PGP-encrypt it to krbcore-security@mit.edu.

You may view bug reports by visiting

    http://krbdev.mit.edu/rt/

and logging in as "guest" with password "guest".

DES transition
--------------

The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is widely recognized as weak.  The
krb5-1.7 release contains measures to encourage sites to migrate away
from using single-DES cryptosystems.  Among these is a configuration
variable that enables "weak" enctypes, which defaults to "false"
beginning with krb5-1.8.

Major changes in 1.9.3
----------------------

This is primarily a bugfix release.

* Fix MITKRB5-SA-2011-007 KDC null pointer dereference in TGS handling
  [CVE-2011-1530].

* Fix an interaction in iprop that could cause spurious excess kadmind
  processes when a kprop child fails.

krb5-1.9.3 changes by ticket ID
-------------------------------

6993    Fix format string for TRACE_INIT_CREDS_SERVICE
7007    Fix intermediate key length in hmac-md5 checksum

* Fix MITKRB5-SA-2011-006 KDC denial of service vulnerabilities
  [CVE-2011-1527 CVE-2011-1528 CVE-2011-1529].

     suppress the PAC instead.

  ** Correctly validate HMAC-MD5 checksums that use DES keys

Major changes in 1.9
--------------------

Additional background information on these changes may be found at

    http://k5wiki.kerberos.org/wiki/Release_1.9

and

    http://k5wiki.kerberos.org/wiki/Category:Release_1.9_projects

Code quality:

* Fix MITKRB5-SA-2010-007 checksum vulnerabilities (CVE-2010-1324 and
  others).

* Add a Python-based testing framework.

* Perform DAL cleanup.

Developer experience:

* Add NSS crypto back end.

* Improve PRNG modularity.

* Add a Fortuna-like PRNG back end.

Performance:

* Account lockout performance improvements -- allow disabling of some
  account lockout functionality to reduce the number of write
  operations to the database during authentication

* Add support for multiple KDC worker processes.

Administrator experience:

* Add Trace logging support to ease the diagnosis of configuration
  problems.

* Add support for purging old keys (e.g. from "cpw -randkey -keepold").

* Add plugin interface for password sync -- based on proposed patches
  by Russ Allbery that support his krb5-sync package

* Add plugin interface for password quality checks -- enables
  pluggable password quality checks similar to Russ Allbery's
  krb5-strength package.

* Add a configuration file validator script.

* Add KDC support for SecurID preauthentication -- this is the old
  SAM-2 protocol, implemented to support existing deployments, not the
  in-progress FAST-OTP work.

* Add "cheat" capability for kinit when running on a KDC host.

Protocol evolution:

* Add support for IAKERB -- a mechanism for tunneling Kerberos KDC
  transactions over GSS-API, enabling clients to authenticate to
  services even when the clients cannot directly reach the KDC that
  serves the services.

* Add support for Camellia encryption (experimental; disabled by
  default).

* Add GSS-API support for implementors of the SASL GS2 bridge
  mechanism.
